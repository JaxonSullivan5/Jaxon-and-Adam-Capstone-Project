Project Status Check 1 questions:

Which parts of the project have you begun constructing to get to the final working solution?
We have started an onShape project to begin designing the base plate that we will 3D print for our assembly to sit on top. The plate will
sit on top of a standard 125 tooth rev gear so it can effectively rotate. We have also started citing sources on a google doc.

Have you ordered all additional parts that will be needed?  When will they arrive if they have not already?
No, we have not ordered any parts yet as we are currently just solidifying the design.

Have you designed any of the parts that will need to be manufactured?  If not, when will those designs be done?
Yes, we have designed the base plate that our arm will sit on and we have started to design exterior plates for the arm to help make it look nice.

If you are able to complete the project by May 13th to your expectations, will you receive full credit in all five functional element categories
Yes, we should be able to meet all five requirements by using LEDs to display outputinformation, a controller for human input,
a distance sensor/camera for sensors, a bunch of servos and motors for the mechanisms, and we will used programmed logic in conjunction with the
distance sensor/camera for Logic, Processing, and Control.

What are the three most significant design challenges you foresee for this project?
Weight distribution with the arm, scaling of the arm, and using a sensor with the arm.
