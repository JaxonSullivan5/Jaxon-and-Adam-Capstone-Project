Design Summary:

Our arm design is based of the EEZYbotARM by Carlo Franciscone. We liked this design other than the fact that it only incorperated mini servos. So we decided to make the design work for servos to be used in the base and we figured we'd make the arm longer to maximize the filament limit. Originally we tried scalling up the original design's dimention by two but that ended up not working because it was over said filament limit and it also was unnecacarily wide. So we scalded the width down to a one and a half times scale for the length and a normal scale for the width. The only place where we did not do this was in the claw section where we simply reused the orginal claw with the addition of a color sensor taped on the the front of the servo. In terms of controlls we just used the two sticks and their stand that were from the original kit with the orginal model arm
